unmarried-taxes
===============

My fiance and I aren't married, which means we have some flexibility in who claims what for deductions.  Figuring out what to do is hard, though, so I wrote this tool to help me experiment with different approaches - it allows you to slide various deductions to one person or the other, and recalculates the taxes owed based on those choices.

To run
======

```
git submodule update --init --remote
npm install
```

Then open the unmarried-taxes.html pagdir
